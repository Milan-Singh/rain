# Basement Flooding

Looking at data for 311 calls around basement flooding. Data is not immediately
available on the Open Data Portal, but WBEZ FOIAed records from 2009 to 2015 for
a story in their Heat of the Moment series: [The Gross Gatherings](http://www.heatofthemoment.org/features/flood/)

The Center for Neighborhood Technology report referenced in the article has
additional information about how basement flooding disproportionately affects Chatham,
along with other neighborhoods in Chicago: [CNT RainReady Chatham](http://www.cnt.org/sites/default/files/publications/CNT_RainReady%20Community%20-%20Chatham.pdf)

## Data Tasks

* Data aggregated to the zip code level exists through the Carto map for the article
[Basement Flooding 311 Table Zip Codes](https://shannonheffernan.carto.com/tables/table_zip_codes/public)
* Will likely have to submit a FOIA request for additional details to 311, example
requests at [311 FOIA Request Log](https://data.cityofchicago.org/FOIA/FOIA-Request-Log-311/j2p9-gdf5),
found from searching for "basement flood"

## Data Analysis Questions

* From the zip code map and information in the article, the South Side, and Chatham
in particular, are disproportionately affected by flooding. What are other highly
affected areas, and what are common threads between them?
* How have recent weather patterns impacted 311 calls for basement flooding?
* Are basement flooding events related to MWRD activities, including combined
sewer overflows?
* Is there a certain threshold of rain that leads to basement flooding, or is it
more related to structural or environmental factors?
