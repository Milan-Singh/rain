# Chicago Rain
An open-source data science project about rainfall in Chicago.

### Interested in contributing?
Whether you're looking to show off your mad skills, or learn some new ones, we'd love you to help us build a unique and remarkable story.  Take a look at our active and proposed projects, and jump onto a team.  Anything that you can contribute is welcomed!

### Active Projects
##### n-year
The Chicago Climate Action plan says that we expect heavier storms due to climate change.  Is this happening?  We are going to attempt to answer this question by focusing on the the n-year event, which is a statistical measurement typically based on historic data denoting the average recurrence interval over an extended period of time.  For example, a 50-year event has a 1/50 chance of occurring in a given year.  For Illinois, the storms are defined in Bulletin 70, located [here](http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/RF/rf.htm)
        
##### transportation
Rainfall affects transit patterns, taxi ridership, divvy demand, and causes that pesky Uber surge pricing.  This team will explore the relationship, and see what types of interesting takeaways can be deduced from the data.

### Other proposals
If you're interested in getting involved with any of the following, please contact Scott Beslow at beslow-scott@norc.org or Pat Sier at sier-patrick@norc.org.

##### Rainfall Distribution
How can it be thunderstorming in one part of the city, and dry in another?  How often does this happen?  Can we show some cool visualizations about this?  How much does it matter in our other models?

##### Combined Sewer Overflows
Build on the work of [istheresewageinthechicagoriver.com](http://istheresewageinthechicagoriver.com) and examine the link between rainfall and the various sewer overfall points.  How much rainfall does it actually take before we start dumping, and where?

##### The Big One
Over the last X years, on what day did we have the absolute worst rainstorm of all?  What happened on that day?

##### Crime
Common sense says that when it rains, certain crimes are less likely.  Tell me more!

##### Basement Flooding
Basement flooding is a big problem in the city.  How can we use rainfall data toward helping residents and businesses alleviate the damage caused?

##### Bike Riders
If you're a rider, how much rain is too much rain before you decide to wait it out?  How can data nerds provide you with more information to make that determination, and be safer on the roads?

##### 311 Calls
The city provides 311 call data on the [open data portal](http://data.cityofchicago.org).  How does rainfall affect various types of calls, and can this be a helpful input into some predictive models?

##### Rush hour rainfall
Heavy storms during rush hour are the worst.
