### Active Projects
* n-year

        The Chicago Climate Action plan says that we expect heavier storms due to climate change.  Is this happening?  We are going to explore this question by tracking the n-year event (also known as the return period or recurrence inverval) is an estimate of the likelihood of a rainfall intensity (inches per period of time). It is a statistical measurement typically based on historic data denoting the average recurrence interval over an extended period of time.  Thus, a 50-year event has a 1/50 chance of occurring in a given year.  For Illinois, the storms are defined in Bulletin 70, located [here](http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/RF/rf.htm)
