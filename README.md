# Chicago Rain
##### ChicagoRains is an open-source data science project exploring how rainfall affects our city, touching on topics including climate change, public transportation, and the dumping of sewage into Lake Michigan and the Chicago River.  Our team is making this important data more accessible to the public, and engaging with citizen data scientists from across the community to analyze and understand it.  Our aim is to create a localized, data-driven story to raise public awareness in order to facilitate change â€“ whether in public policy,  infrastructure investment,  and/or individual habit.

### Our List of Questions

##### Rainfall Distribution
It can be thunderstorming in one part of the city, and dry in another.
* Quantify and/or visualize how rainfall falls unevenly around the city -- by region?  ward?  zipcode? neighborhood?
* What kinds of things does this help us model?




### How this works
The directories in this repo distinguish different storylines.  Check them out and see if anything suits your fancy.



##### N-year storm
The Chicago Climate Action plan says that we expect heavier storms due to climate change.  Is this happening?  We are going to attempt to answer this question by focusing on the the n-year event, which is a statistical measurement typically based on historic data denoting the average recurrence interval over an extended period of time.  For example, a 50-year event has a 1/50 chance of occurring in a given year.  For Illinois, the storms are defined in Bulletin 70, located [here](http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/RF/rf.htm).  This group is currently jamming on data -- mostly in Python.  Come join us.

##### Combined Sewer Overflows
Build on the work of [istheresewageinthechicagoriver.com](http://istheresewageinthechicagoriver.com) and examine the link between rainfall and the various sewer overfall points.  How much rainfall does it actually take before we start dumping, and where?  How does rain have to fall in order to predict what it takes to cause a CSO?  How often do we dump sewage in Lake Michigan, and how much rain does it take?  This group is currently jamming on data -- mostly in Python.  Come join us.



##### Transportation
Rainfall affects transit patterns, taxi ridership, divvy demand, and causes that pesky Uber surge pricing.  This team will explore the relationship.

##### July 23, 2001
On this day, 6.86 inches of rain fell on Chicago -- the most ever in a single day, but most of it fell in a 3-hour span.  What was the aftermath of that?  How did the CSOs look?  The bulk of it was overnight, so perhaps focus at next morning rush hour(?).

##### Crime
Common sense says that when it rains, certain crimes are less likely.  Tell me more!

##### Rush hour rainfall
Heavy storms during rush hour are the worst.  Dive into rainfall data specifically at those times.

##### Bike Riders
If you're a rider, how much rain is too much rain before you decide to wait it out?  How can data nerds provide you with more information to make that determination, and be safer on the roads?

##### Basement Flooding
How can we use rainfall data toward helping residents and businesses alleviate the damage caused?  Can we predict when a house will flood?

##### 311 Calls
The city provides 311 call data on the [open data portal](http://data.cityofchicago.org).  How does rainfall affect various types of calls, and can this be a helpful input into some predictive models?
